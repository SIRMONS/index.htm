            The Beyond Corporation is a collective of beings who embody the wild spaces beyond reality.<br>
             While the other entities from the Outside want to study and even preserve the Multiverse population,<br> the Beyond Corp cares only to play with them and have fun.
             They are considered "rogue Beyonders"<br> by other Beyonders.
